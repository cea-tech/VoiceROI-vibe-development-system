# VoiceROI Vibe Development System

A 10‑phase, AI‑assisted development system for building production‑grade voice and AI applications at **VoiceROI**.

This repository documents the **process**, not the product. It is designed so non‑traditional engineers (founders, operators, product leaders) can reliably direct AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to produce real, deployable systems without “going in circles.”

## 📌 What This Repo Is

This repo is the **single source of truth** for how VoiceROI builds:

- Real‑time voice agents (LiveKit + Deepgram + Cartesia + Llama + Cerebrium)
- Future AI products built with “vibe coding” tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Any complex system that has multiple moving parts (APIs, infra, async logic)

It contains:

- A **10‑phase execution system** for using Claude Code with high accuracy
- Exact prompts to copy‑paste into Claude Code (no guesswork)
- Verification steps for every phase (so you know when things actually work)
- Templates and checklists reusable for any new VoiceROI project
